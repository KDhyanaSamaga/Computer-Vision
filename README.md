# Computer Vision Projects  

This repository contains assignments and a detailed report showcasing various image processing techniques using **Java** and **Python**. The projects demonstrate practical implementations of core computer vision concepts.  

## Projects Overview  

### 1. **Pseudocolor Image Processing (Java)**  
- Convert grayscale images to pseudocolor and analyze their applications.  
- Implements a GUI using **Swing** to display processed images.  

### 2. **Image Enhancement and Restoration (Python)**  
- Demonstrates image point processing, histogram equalization, and filtering techniques.  
- Implements noise reduction and sharpening using Python libraries like **OpenCV** and **NumPy**.  

### 3. **Segmentation, Morphological, and Color Processing (Python)**  
- Implements segmentation, morphological operations, and color image processing.  
- Explores practical approaches to object recognition and feature extraction.
